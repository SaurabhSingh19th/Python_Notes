"""5. if you get the new features in between then """

"5.1 what are the procedures to follow"
# you know changes are the part of the work. When I was working on previous company, we were working on Agile Environment
# In Agile Environment, Where the objects & the application scenario flows are constantly changing.
# you know if requirement changes => corresponding design changes => if the design changes the code has to be changed => because of which Testing approach will change because there will be lot of defects while testing.


" 5.2 what was your first expression when you get a new features"
# when I was new on that then I was worried later on I was familier with it.

"5.3 How to resolve this type of problem"
# As Automation Test Engineer first I've to understand the updated requirement if there is a problem to understand the requirement then discuss with Manual test engineer, Test lead, Project Manager even though I still have problem then discussed with BA.

# If we get any changes then we discussed on meetings, in this meeting scrum master tells what are the procedures we have to follow.


"5.4 Meetings"
# Meetings coducted in Agile Enviroment
# 1. Sprint planning meeting: Assign the task to each engg. & keep a track of it.
#
# 2. Stand-up meeting: here entire scrum team meets, this meeting is completely done by scrum master. In this meeting
# each engg. Should tell
# 2.1 What they have done yesterday
# 2.2 What are the hurdles/problems they have faced yesterdayâ€™s task
# 2.3 What activities are planning to do today?
#
# 3. Sprint review meeting: Demo of the product
#
# 4. Retrospect meeting:  discuss achievements & drawbacks or we can say that summary of the product.


"""6. what type of challenges you have faced in your previous projects? 7. How to prioties the defects?"""
# We are Test Engineer & we have good knowledge on the s/w & we know how each features work so on the basic of knowledge we identify the severity & priority.

# Note: Severity & Priority both are given by Test Engineers. (Test lead, Development lead also give the priority)
# Developer will always fix the defect based on the priority given & not an severity.

"""10. Give me some example of priority (what is priority or types)"""

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for A2A. It's very real time question and in this situation what you can do is first verify that defect/bug is 
valid or not ? If it is valid then try to reproduce in different system and send screenshot, proper defect report to 
developer. Now even after this developer is not accepting then you can send email to respective developer regarding 
issue and cc to you test lead.

If Test lead is also not taking it seriously or not accepting then you can escalate this issue to Test Manager. 
Even though if they are not accepting then take final call with Business Analyst or Product Owner. B.A/P.O is the 
person who closely interact with client/business, so you can check with him. If B.A is telling this is not a bug then 
you can write a B.A comment in JIRA/Test Case and close it.

If B.A is accepting this as a defect/bug then send email and inform why this is a bug to respective developer, 
cc to development lead, test lead, test manager, B.A/P.O

# Both are built-in (collection value) data types in Python but there are some differences in between

# 1. list is mutable data type & dictionary is also mutable data type but in dictionary key must be Immutable data type
# value can be mutable.
#
# 2. List contains duplicates value whereas, in dictionary value can be duplicates but key must be unique or not be
# duplicated otherwise it can be a data loss.

# 3. Syntax wise: list collection is enclosed by Square braces [] & all the elements seperated by comma (,) operators,
# while, dictionary collection is enclosed by curly braces {} & each pair is seperated by comma(,) operators & key &
# value is seperated by colon (:).

# 4. Indexing & slicing both are possible in List but in dictionary can't be supported. Dictionaries are indexed by keys

# 5. some built-in-methods of list are => .append(), .insert(), .remove(), .index(), .count(), .clear(), .sort(), .reverse() etc
# some buit-in-methods of Dictionary are => .keys(), .values(), .items(), .get(), .pop(), .popitem(), .clear(), .update({key: value})

#  (URL is provided by Developer) C stands for Create (but in API Post), R => Read (Get), U => Update (Put/Fetch) and
#  D => Delete (Delete).
#  We use API when the frontend is not ready.
#  There are two types of website 1. Normal website 2. Secured website
#  While doing on Secured website we need authentication so here we use "Bearer Token", "OAuth 2.0".
#  let us take one e.g.
#  Suppose I want to perform API on Github. We can't perform directly because it is secured website so what can I do.

# Response time   => It is the total time taken to send the request to the server, time taken to run the program & also
#                     the time taken to response-back to the user i.e. T = T1 + T2 + T3
# Load            => load is nothing but the number of users.
#
# Types of performance testing:
# testing the stability & response time of an application
# 1. Load testing     => by applying the load which is equal to or less than the number of users
# 2. Stress testing   => by applying the load which is more than the number of users

""" 30.Define agile methodology """
# It is a model where we develop the software is an incremental & iterative manner.
# In order to overcome the drawback which was there in all previous models we have come up with Agile model
# Here we build larger product in a shorter cycles called as sprint.

# Incremental       => because we are giving the software in incremental order to the customer.
# Iterative model   => bcz in all the cycle we are repeating the same process/stages
#                       i.e Requirement collection, Feasibility study, Design, code, test

# Meeting conducted in Agile Methodlogy
# Sprint planning meeting: Assign the task to each engg. & keep a track of it.
# Stand-up meeting: here entire scrum team meets, this meeting is completely done by scrum master. In this meeting each engg. Should tell
# What they have done yesterday
# What are the hurdles/problems they have faced yesterdayâ€™s task
# What activities are planning to do today?
# Sprint review meeting: Demo of the product
# Retrospect meeting:  discuss achievements & drawbacks or we can say that summary of the product.

# 1) Overloading:
# 	1) Operator Overloading
# 	2) Method Overloading
# 	3) Constructor Overloading

# 2) Overriding:
# 	1) Method Overriding
# 	2) Constructor Overriding

""" Method overloading VS method overriding,explain with example"""

# Method Overloading
# If two methods have the same name but different type of arguments then those methods are said to be overloaded methods.
#
# In Python, method overloading is not possible.
#
# If we are trying to declare multiple methods with same name and different number of arguments then python will always
# consider only last method.

# class demo:
#     def m1(self):
#         print("no argument method")
#
#     def m1(self,x):
#         print("one argument method")
#
#     def m1(self,x,y):
#         print("two argument method")
#
#
# s=demo()
# s.m1(2,7)


# Method Overriding
# Whatever members available in the parent class are by default available to the child class through inheritance.
#
# If the child class is not satisfied with parent class implementation, then, the  child class is allowed to redefine
# that method in the child class based on its requirement. This concept is called overriding.


# class Parent:
#     def greet(self):
#         print("Good Morning")
#
#
# class Child(Parent):
#     def greet(self):
#         print("Hello Everyone, Have a great day")
#
#
# s = Child()
# s.greet()			# Hello Everyone, Have a great day

""" Constructor Overloading VS Constructor Overriding"""
# Constructor Overloading:
# Constructor overloading is not possible in Python. If we define multiple constructors then the last constructor will
# be considered.

# class demo:
#     def __init__(self):
#         print("no argument method")
#     def __init__(self,x):
#         print("one argument method")
#     def __init__(self,x,y):
#         print("two argument method")
# s = demo(2,3)


# Constructor Overriding:
# overriding concept is applicable for constructor overriding

# class Parent:
#     def __init__(self):
#         print("parent constructor")
# class Child(Parent):
#     def __init__(self):
#         print("child constructor")

""" Operator Overloading """
# â€¢	We can use the same operator for multiple purposes, which is nothing but operator overloading.
# â€¢	Python supports operator overloading.
# â€¢	java won't support operator overloading
#
# e.g 1: same + operator can be used for Arithmetic addition and String concatenation
#  print(10 + 20)
#  print('hello' + 'world')
#
# e.g 2: same * operator can be used for multiplication and string repetition purposes.
#  print(10 * 20)
#  print("hai" * 3)
#
# e.g 3: operator overloading can also be used in the object that is created from class:--->
#
# class Book:
#     def __init__(self, pages):
#         self.pages = pages
#
#
# b1 = Book(200)
# b2 = Book(300)
#
# print(b1 + b2)
#
# #TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'book' and 'book'
#
# # How to overcome it
#
# Note:->
# â€¢	Python provides support for operator overloading using a Magic method
# â€¢	For every operator Magic Methods are available
# â€¢	Here in this example whenever the controller/interpreter sees print(b1+b2), automatically it calls ma agic method, here we have use magic method   __add__(self, other)

"""Que. What are magic methods?"""
#
# Magic methods are special methods which starts and ends with double underscores. It is internally called by python. We can customise the behaviour of an object or class using magic methods. They are also called as protocols.
#
# e.g. when you ask for the length of the list len(names) internally python will call _len_ method on list object.
#
# E.g. when you check for membership "apple" in names python internally triggers _contains_("apple")

#    3.  Hierarchical inheritance
#    4.  Multiple inheritance
#    5.  Hybrid inheritance
#    6.  Cyclic inheritance
# Python as well as Java won't support cyclic inheritance.

# Constructor overloading
# Multiple constructor is possible in a single class
# if we have multiple constructor (__init__) in a class then it will considered latest one.
# by default constructor will return None
# Multiple constructor is not possible in Python => to solve this problem by using default value => i.e. constructor overloading

""" 11. what are the keywords available in Python ? """
# Keywords are reserved words that have a specific meaning associated with them, we can't modify the meaning of
# Keywords, we can only utilize the meaning as per our requirement in the program.
#
# Keywords are case-sensitive
#
# Total no of keywords, depends on Version of the software
# e.g 33 keywords => before Python 3.7
#     35 keywords =>  after Python 3.7
#
# Some keywords are:
# import, True, False, is, in, not, if, else, elif, def, for, while, lambda, global, nonlocal, break, continue, pass,
# None, class, return, yield, try, raise, with, except, finally, and, or, as, assert, await, from
