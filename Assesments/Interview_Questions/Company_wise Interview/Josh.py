* A working example of Square root in Python

Pythagoras theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the side opposite to the right angle called the hypotenuse is measured as the square root of the sum of squares of measures of the other two sides, which means
c=√(a2+b2) # where c is the hypotenuse

Here is the solution in Python:

from math import sqrt #Imported the square root function from math module

 from math import pow #Imported the power function from math module

 a=int(input("Enter the measure of one side of a right angled triangle:"))

 b=int(input("Enter the measure of another side of a right angled triangle:"))

 #input function is used to take input from user and is stored as string

# which is then typecasted into an integer using the int() function.

 c=sqrt(pow(a,2)+pow(b,2))

 #we have implemented the formula c=√(a2+b2)

 print(f"The measure of the hypotenuse is: {c} based on the measures of the other two sides {a} & {b}")


OUTPUT:
Enter the measure of one side of a right-angled triangle :3
Enter the measure of another side of a right-angled triangle: 4
The measure of the hypotenuse is: 5.0 based on the measures of the other two sides 3 & 4
